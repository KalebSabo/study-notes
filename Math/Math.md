# Math Notes

## Algebra
- Studies the non-empty set of mathematical objects with algebraic operations
    !['See AlgebraTerms.png in the images folder for a breakdown on the structure for an algebraic expression](../05_Images/AlgebraTerms.png)

### Quantity
- Refers to a **measurable property** of an object/system

### Magnitude
- Represents the **size or extent of a quantity**

### Scalar 
- mathematical and physical quantity that **only has a magnitude**
- Algebra

## Geometry

### End point
- A specific location

### Line Segment
- a straight line bounded by two distinct endpoints
    - Contains all the points between them
- A **Line** extends infinitely in both directions, hence the addition of segment

### Radius or Radii
- refers to the line segments form the center of a circle or sphere to it's perimeter

### Vector
- mathematical and physical quantity that has both **magnitude and *direction***
    - Mathematically displayed as a line of numbers
        - [ 1, 3, 5, 10, 20 ]  
    - Or in physics as a line with a magnitude
        - 20m ------->
- Vector Algebra

### Triangles
- 2 Dimensional, closed-shape, with three angles/three straight sides/three corners(vertices) 
    - The total angles should add up to 180 degrees

### Right Triangle
- A right triangle always has a $90\degree$ angle
    - **Theta** $\theta$ = One angle inside the triangle
    - **Opposite** = The *opposite* side of angle Theta
    - **Adjacent** = The side *next* to angle Theta
    - **Hypotenuse** = The side from the end of the Adjacent to the end of the Opposite, aka the *long* one

### Sine, Cosine and Tangent
- Ratios of sides of a right angled (90 $\degree$) triangle
- For a given angle ($\theta$) each ratio stays the same no matter how big or small the triangle is
    - **Sine**
        - Sin($\theta$) = $\frac{Opposite}{Hypotenuse}$
    - **Cosine**
        - Cos($\theta$) = $\frac{Adjacent}{Hypotenuse}$
    - **Tangent**
        - Tan($\theta$) = $\frac{Opposite}{Adjacent}$

### Pythagorean Theorum
- $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ 

### Dot Product
- Two vectors can be multiplied
    - $a * b$ = $|a| * |b| * \cos{\theta}$
        - $a$ = vector $a$
        - $b$ = vector $b$
        - $\theta$ = angle between the two vectors

### Cross Product

## Circle
- The set of all points in a plane that are at a fixed distance from a central point, aka the center.
    - **Radius** = Distance from the center to the edge
    - **Diameter** = A straight line across the circle, through the center
    - **Circumference** = Distance *once* around the circle
        - Divide the **Circumference** by the **Diameter** = $\pi$ aka pi aka 3.14159...
    - $d * \pi = C = 2 * \pi * r$
        - $d$ = Diameter
        - $C$ = Circumference
        - $\pi$ = 3.14159
        - $r$ = Radius

### Area
- Area of a circle is $\pi$ times the radius squared
    - $A = \pi * r^2$
#### Area of a Circle by Lines
- A circle becomes a triangle (take the radius straight down, decouple the top radius, fold open)
    - You can then derive the area of a circle this way

### Special Names
- **Tangent** = A line that "just touches" the circle as it passes
- **Secant** = A line that cuts the circle at two points
- **Chord** = A line segment that goes from one point to another on the circle's circumference
- **Arc** = A part of the circumference

### Slices
- **Sector** = A "pizza" slice/ ~(3/8)
    - **Quadrant** = A special **Sector** with a right angle (90 $\degree$)
- **Segment** = A slice made by a **Chord**
- **Semicircle** = Half a circle

### Equations
- To find radius (Useful when the circle is not on the origin)
- $(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2$
    - $x$ = the distance on the x-axis to a point on the circumference
    - $a$ = the distance on the x-axis to the center point
    - $y$ = the distance on the y-axis to a point on the circumference
    - $b$ = the distance on the y-axis to the center point
    - $r$ = radius


## Matrix
- A rectangular array of numbers
    - #### Rows
        - [1, 5, 67, 7, 8]
            - Horizontal
    - #### Columns
        - 2,
        - 4, 
        - 59, 
        - 1,
        - 9,
- Combine Rows/Columns for a matrix
    - Denoted as $m$(Rows) x $n$(Columns)
- Matrix Algebra

### Scalar Multiplication
- Using a single number/Coefficient to 'scale' a matrix
    - Multiply each matrix element by the number/Coefficient

### Matrix Multiplication
- A binary operation
    - The product is a matrix from 2 other matrices
        - The *matrix product* will have the same number of '**rows** as the **first**'/'**columns** as the **second**'
- Matrix multiplication is used in computer graphics to apply transformations like rotation, scaling, or translation of shapes

## Tensor
- Scalar, Vector and Matrix are all properties of Tensors
- Tensor Algebra
