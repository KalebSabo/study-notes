# Material Notes
- This file will focus on physical/material characteristics of Eragon

## Thermodynamics

### Conductivity (k)
- Electrons transfer energy efficiently

### Diffusivity ($a$)
- The speed of spreading heat through a material
- #### Diffusion
    - The net movement of anything generally from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.

### Emissivity ($\epsilon$)
- Shiny *surface* reflects rather than radiates

### Thermal Diffusivity
- Rate of heat transfer inside a material
    - "The rate at which temperature concavity (think acceleration of temperature) is smoothed out"
    - A substance with high thermal diffusivity will have heat move quickly through it.
        - heat conductivity relative to its energy storage capacity/"thermal bulk" 
- #### 'Flash' Method
    - Measured physically with the 'flash' method
        - heat a strip/cylindrical sample with a small energy pulse at one end and measure the temperature travel through the strip. 

### Fourier Number ($F_o or Fo_L$)
- dimensionless parameter, analyzes the unsteady state of heat transfer
- quantifies the rate of heat conduction and the rate the heat is stored within a material
- $(\begin{equation} F_O=\frac{\alpha \tau}{L_C^2} \end{equation})$
    - $a$ = Thermal Diffusivity
    - $\tau$ = Time (s)
    - $L_c$ = Characteristic Length (Volume / Area)

## Crystallography
- Study of crystalline structures and properties
- Natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure

### Thermodynamics of Crystallization
- Annealing occurs by the diffusion of atoms within a solid material

### Annealing
- A heat treatment
- Heating causes atoms to migrate to form a crystal lattice

## 3D Printing
- aka Additive Manufacturing


### Polylactic Acid (PLA)
- A common 3D printing filament
    - Low heat resistance, deforms ~60 C 
        - Can be mitigated by Annealing
- Made by Condensation of Lactic Acid with loss of water
