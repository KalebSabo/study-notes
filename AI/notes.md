# AI Notes

## Data

## Tensors 
- Essentially neural networks in models are tensors (3D containers of numbers)
- Computation of these tensors is what causes massive *training* 
    
## Weights
- 

## Backpropagation
- 

## Training
- Adjusting the numbers inside the tensors to find configurations that generate good outputs



## Inference
