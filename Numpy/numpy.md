# A study file for Numpy
- Numpy's main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. aka storing multiple like items 
- In Numpy, dimensions on a matrix are known as *axes*

## Basics
- 1 axis = 1 coordinate point in 3D space
    - the number of elements inside the axes = length
    - [6, 7, 8] = length of 3
    
## Types
- you can specify types inside the elements in the array. (limited to python types)
    - to go beyond the limitations of Python, using things like numpy.float64, numpy.int16
    

## Array
- **ndarray** aka **array** = Numpy's array class
    - Can create different sizes of matrices with various data types within the elements
