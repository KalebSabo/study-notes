# AI Notes

## Data

## Matrices
- Each element in an output matrix is a relationship score between a row from one matrix and a column of another
    - The cool part is now the score relates directly to how these two matrices are close to each other
    - Taking a step further, if the output matrix is high = high relation, and vice versa, low or even negative = low/no/negative relation
        - think Cat vs. Airplane, turn those into their mathematical equivalent matrices, multiply, and it would likely be a low matrix(low relationship)
    - Multiply the *query* matrix with a *key* matrix 

## Tensors 
- Essentially neural networks in models are tensors (3D containers of numbers)
- Computation of these tensors is what causes massive *training* 
    
## Weights
- 

## Backpropagation
- 

## Training
- Adjusting the numbers inside the tensors to find configurations that generate good outputs



## Inference
