# Math Notes

## Algebra
- Studies the non-empty set of mathematical objects with algebraic operations
    !['See AlgebraTerms.png in the images folder for a breakdown on the structure for an algebraic expression](../05_Images/AlgebraTerms.png)

### Quantity
- Refers to a **measurable property** of an object/system

### Magnitude
- Represents the **size or extent of a quantity**

### Scalar 
- mathematical and physical quantity that **only has a magnitude**
- Algebra

## Geometry

### End point
- A specific location

### Line Segment
- a straight line bounded by two distinct endpoints
    - Contains all the points between them
- A **Line** extends infinitely in both directions, hence the addition of segment

### Radius or Radii
- refers to the line segments form the center of a circle or sphere to it's perimeter

### Vector
- mathematical and physical quantity that has both **magnitude and *direction***
    - Mathematically displayed as a line of numbers
        - [ 1, 3, 5, 10, 20 ]  
    - Or in physics as a line with a magnitude
        - 20m ------->
- Vector Algebra

### Triangles
- 2 Dimensional, closed-shape, with three angles/three straight sides/three corners(vertices) 
    - The total angles should add up to 180 degrees

### Pythagorean Theorum
- $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ 

### Dot Product
- Two vectors can be multiplied
    - $a * b$ = $|a| * |b| * \cos{\theta}$
        - $a$ = vector $a$
        - $b$ = vector $b$
        - $\theta$ = angle between the two vectors

### Cross Product

## Matrix
- A rectangular array of numbers
    - #### Rows
        - [1, 5, 67, 7, 8]
            - Horizontal
    - #### Columns
        - 2,
        - 4, 
        - 59, 
        - 1,
        - 9,
- Combine Rows/Columns for a matrix
    - Denoted as $m$(Rows) x $n$(Columns)
- Matrix Algebra

### Scalar Multiplication
- Using a single number/Coefficient to 'scale' a matrix
    - Multiply each matrix element by the number/Coefficient

### Matrix Multiplication
- A binary operation
    - The product is a matrix from 2 other matrices
        - The *matrix product* will have the same number of '**rows** as the **first**'/'**columns** as the **second**'
- Matrix multiplication is used in computer graphics to apply transformations like rotation, scaling, or translation of shapes

## Tensor
- Scalar, Vector and Matrix are all properties of Tensors
- Tensor Algebra

## Euclidean Geometry
